# Assessment 1
For this assignment I had to visualize data by using d3. I had to start over a few times, but that's a good way to learn!

## Top languages by number of speaker
This was the assignment I eventually chose. The goal was to visualize the total of speakers and the language they spoke. The data was already given 
to me. Originally I went with a different dataset, one about the weather, but I had much difficulty finding a good chart to display this.
After a few tries I decided to switch data sets.

## My journey to succes
I started by deciding how I want to display the data. I went with the bar chart. This seemed the best way to display the information.
I went to look back at my previous work to see what I did and how it worked, but I didn't wanted to copy paste everything, 
because I wouldn't learn from it at all. I went online to find a more basic chart and to see how that one was made. I took basic bits from
it and styled it to my preference. By combining the code from my old barchart, my new barchart and other previous assignments
I was on my way for a basic set up. I went online to search terms and code in d3 which I can use. 
The most usefull ones were the ``scale`` attribute and the use of attributes. After filling my bars with color and finaly got my numbers 
to show in millions (I found this way more better to display than the numbers) I decided it was time to make a hover, so I can show 
the data in more presize numbers. Like I said in the beginning, I don't want to take the code from my original bar chart where it was 
already been made, because that's really boring. 

I went online to find out a easy way to make this function. I soon found the `tooltip` function. After a few clicks I found a good tutorial
on how to make this, quick and easy. After this I was finaly done!

## Conclusion
d3 is awesome.
